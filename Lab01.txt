Lab Tasks
1. Identifying the Current Directory
Task 1.1: Using pwd Command
•	Concept : The pwd command stands for "print working directory". It displays the full path to the current directory.
# pwd
•	Explanation : Running the pwd command will print the absolute path of your current directory on the terminal. This helps in confirming where you are within the filesystem structure.

2. Exploring Directories
Task 2.1: Listing Files with ls Command
•	Concept : The ls command is used to list the contents of a directory.
# ls
•	Explanation : The basic ls command will list the files and directories in the current directory.
Task 2.2: Listing with Options
•	Concept : Options can modify the behavior of the ls command. Common options include:

3. Changing Directories
Task 3.1: Navigating with cd Command
•	Concept : The cd command is used to change the current directory.
# cd [directory_path]
Example: To change to a directory named Documents:
# cd Documents
•	Explanation : If the directory path is relative (like Documents), it's based on your current location.
•	For an absolute path, provide the full directory path starting from root (e.g., /home/user/Documents).
Task 3.2: Navigating to Parent Directory
•	Concept: Use cd .. to move up to the parent directory.
# cd ..
•	Explanation: This command will take you one level up the directory hierarchy.
